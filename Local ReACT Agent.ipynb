It recognized that it first needed to identify the person (Identity) before it could determine their financial status (Attribute). It did not attempt to guess the name, immediately acknowledging the need for external information.\n",

        "Analysis: The input was a concise keyword search rather than a natural language question. This is generally efficient for search engines. However, the agent repeated the exact same search query twice (in Step 1 and Step 2), which indicates a lack of refinement.

        "\n",
        "Identity Confusion: The agent states \"There is no current CEO\" but immediately contradicts itself by saying \"Linda Yaccarino took over.\" This suggests it was confused by the rebranding from Twitter to X.\n",

        "Gender/Pronoun Bias: The user asked \"what is his net worth.\" The agent found a female CEO (Linda Yaccarino) but, likely influenced by the user's pronoun \"his,\" decided to answer with Elon Musk's net worth instead of Linda's.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion: The agent prioritized the user's linguistic cue (\"his\") over the factual hierarchy (the CEO is Linda), resulting in a disjointed answer where the CEO is identified as Linda, but the net worth provided is Elon's."

        "#Analysis:\n",
        "#1. Tool Selection Strategy (Routing)\n",
        "Observation: The agent demonstrated excellent semantic routing. It correctly identified the context of the query to select the appropriate tool without hesitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Evidence:\n",
        "\n",
        "Internal Query: When asked about \"Project Chimera\" (a fictional entity defined only in the vector store), the agent immediately triggered search_internal_documents. It did not attempt to search the web for this private information.\n",
        "\n",
        "External Query: When asked about \"Tesla stock price\" (public, real-time information), the agent immediately triggered duckduckgo_search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Verdict: The tool descriptions provided in the code (e.g., \"Use this for questions about Project Chimera\") were highly effective. The specific keyword \"Project Chimera\" acted as a strong trigger for the local model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Information Integration (Observation to Reasoning)\n",
        "Observation (Memory):\n",
        "\n",
        "The retrieved documents provided clear facts: \"budget... 500 million\" and \"lead engineer... Dr. Elena Vance.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Issue: The agent entered a verification loop. The log shows it performing the same search_internal_documents action multiple times (at least 4-5 times), getting the exact same result, and thinking \"I already know this information... but I'll reiterate it for clarity.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis: While it retrieved the correct data, the Llama 3.2 model struggled to trust its own context, resulting in redundant API calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observation (Web):\n",
        "\n",
        "The web search returned \"noisy\" data with conflicting dates (snippets mentioning 2020, 2021, and even a hallucinated/future date of \"Jan 27, 2026\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Success: Despite the noise, the agent successfully extracted the specific value \"$456.56\" buried in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nuance: The agent was skeptical of the data quality, adding a disclaimer in the Final Answer: \"The information... might be outdated.\" This indicates the model has a high degree of \"honesty\" or safety alignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#3. Recommendations for Prompt Improvement\n",
        "To fix the looping behavior and improve confidence, the following adjustments are recommended:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fix the Looping (Repetition):\n",
        "\n",
        "Current Issue: The agent keeps searching for what it already found.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improvement: Update the system prompt with a \"Termination Condition.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Add this to prompt: \"If the Observation contains the answer, you MUST output the 'Final Answer' immediately. Do not repeat the same Action.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Fix the \"Outdated\" Fear:\n",
        "\n",
        "Current Issue: The agent apologized that web data might be old.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improvement: Update the duckduckgo_search tool description.\n",
        "\n",
        "Change to: \"A search engine. Use this to find current, real-time events and stock prices. Assume results labeled 'Today' or 'Live' are accurate.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Conclusion\n",
        "The integration of Long-Term Memory was successful. The agent creates a clear boundary between \"Secret Knowledge\" (Vector Store) and \"Public Knowledge\" (Web). The primary issue observed was efficiency (looping actions) rather than accuracy."

        "#CONCLUSION\n",
        "In this session, we successfully built a robust ReAct (Reason + Act) Agent capable of distinguishing between internal secrets and external real-time data. We started by configuring a local Llama 3.2 model via Ollama to run efficiently on Google Colab using background threading. By leveraging LangChain, we orchestrated the agent's logic, initially giving it \"eyes\" with the DuckDuckGo Search tool to fetch live information like stock prices. We then evolved the architecture by integrating Long-Term Memory using a FAISS vector store, allowing the agent to recall private \"Project Chimera\" details without hallucinating or leaking data to the web. The final result was a context-aware agent that demonstrated intelligent routing—automatically deciding whether to query its internal memory or search the internet based on the user's intent, all while maintaining a transparent \"Thought → Action → Observation\" reasoning loop."
