Existing law authorizes the department to designate any demographic parts of the state as regional cancer incidence reporting areas and establish regional cancer registries to provide cancer incidence data. Existing law requires any hospital or other facility providing therapy to cancer patients within a cancer reporting area to report each case of cancer to the department or the authorized representative of the department in a format prescribed by the department. Existing law provides that if the hospital or other facility fails to report in a format prescribed by the department, the department’s authorized representative is authorized to access the information from the hospital or the facility and report it in the appropriate format. In these cases, existing law requires the hospital or other health facility to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. Existing law also requires any physician, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner diagnosing or providing treatment for cancer patients to report each cancer case to the department or the authorized representative of the department, except for those cases directly referred to a treatment facility or those previously admitted to a treatment facility for diagnosis or treatment of that instance of cancer. | An act to amend Section 103885 of the Health and Safety Code, relating to cancer.                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

If a pathologist fails to report electronically and with an approved format, the bill would authorize the department’s authorized representative to access the information from the pathologist in an appropriate alternative format. In these cases, the bill would require the pathologist to reimburse the department or the authorized representative for its cost to access and report the information. The bill would require the department to prescribe the data required to be included in the reports and to work collaboratively with stakeholders to designate a standardized electronic format for submission of the reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

            "| The people of the State of California do enact as follows:                        | Existing law, the Housing Authorities Law, declares that providing safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income is a public use and purpose for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, and is a governmental function of state concern. Existing law establishes procedures by which a local government may create or authorize a local housing authority to operate within it for this purpose. Existing law authorizes those housing authorities to convey surplus lands, as specified, for the development of homes for ownership by persons and families of low or moderate income. Existing law requires every local housing authority within a county or city to file on the first day of October of each year with the Department of Housing and Community Development a complete report of its activities during the previous fiscal year, with specified recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | An act to add                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

        "#CONCLUSION\n",
        "Based on the experiment, the pre-trained autoregressive GPT-2 model significantly outperformed the vanilla GRU model built from scratch. The results are definitive, with GPT-2 achieving a ROUGE-1 score of 0.1310, vastly exceeding the scratch model's 0.0220. This performance gap was consistent across ROUGE-2 (0.0288 vs. 0.0029) and ROUGE-L (0.0886 vs. 0.0192). This outcome highlights that for complex tasks like summarization, the advanced Transformer architecture and, more importantly, the extensive pre-training of large language models like GPT-2 provide a clear and substantial advantage over simpler models trained on limited data."
